## Project Introduction

This project allows any researcher to start pre-training a fully aligned RWKV v7 model within 15 minutes. Of course, this does not include the time to download the data :)

All code is sourced from the original RWKV-LM project: https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM

This repository is suitable for quickly reproducing small-scale RWKV v7 series models (e.g., 191M to 3B) on NVIDIA & AMD GPUs using either sample data or private data. We will focus on the following improvements next:

-   Provide template code for RWKV series models for tasks such as multimodal applications.
-   Provide cross-platform kernel implementations.
-   Provide a configurable RWKV Layer class.
-   Provide a high-performance PyTorch inference implementation.
-   Provide a cluster training framework and scripts suitable for models from 3B to 70B.

We love and give back to the open-source community and appreciate any implementations from it. If you find any issues in our code repository, including but not limited to code quality, code style, code interpretability, or numerical precision errors, you are welcome to [submit an issue](https://github.com/RWKV-Vibe/RWKV-LM-V7/issues/new).

> [!WARNING]
> Note: This is WIP (very likely correct, and more efficient). On the other hand, you can still use [RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/tree/main/RWKV-v7/train_temp) as reference implementation.

## How to start?

### Prepare Environment

To prepare the environment, please use UV that is very fast and easy to use.
```
uv venv ./rwkv-lm --python 3.12
source ./rwkv-lm/bin/activate
```
Next, install the following dependencies. Please note that `pytorch-lightning` is fixed at version `1.9.5`. This is a specific requirement for this repository; do not upgrade this package.
```
uv pip install torch
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Data

```
wget -O data/minipile.idx https://huggingface.co/datasets/BlinkDL/minipile-tokenized/resolve/main/rwkv_vocab_v20230424/minipile.idx
wget -O data/minipile.bin https://huggingface.co/datasets/BlinkDL/minipile-tokenized/resolve/main/rwkv_vocab_v20230424/minipile.bin
```
### Start Training

1. Initialize an empty RWKV-7 model
```
sh ./demo-training-prepare.sh
```

2. Log in to your WandB account

3. Start training
```
sh ./demo-training-run.sh
```

## 13.3B Workflow

This repository also contains a practical 13.3B / DeepSpeed workflow for long-running training, clean shutdown, resume, checkpoint conversion, and inference.

### Start 13.3B Training

The main launcher script is [run_12b_zero3_offload.sh](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/run_12b_zero3_offload.sh). Edit the model path, dataset path, context length, and the three dataset-dependent values first:

- `VOCAB_SIZE`
- `MY_EXIT_TOKENS`
- `MAGIC_PRIME`

Then start training:

```bash
bash run_12b_zero3_offload.sh
```

Useful training-side notes:

- This script currently uses `--strategy deepspeed_stage_3_offload`
- `--save_every_n_steps` and `--keep_last_n_checkpoints` are supported by `train.py`
- step checkpoints are named like `rwkv-step-200.pth`
- epoch checkpoints are named like `rwkv-10.pth`

### Stop Training Cleanly

Use [scripts/stop_rwkv_train.sh](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/scripts/stop_rwkv_train.sh) instead of killing random worker PIDs.

Find the launcher PID:

```bash
pgrep -fo 'python .*train\.py'
```

Stop it cleanly:

```bash
bash scripts/stop_rwkv_train.sh "$(pgrep -fo 'python .*train\.py')"
```

The stop script sends:

1. `SIGINT`
2. `SIGTERM`
3. `SIGKILL`

This greatly reduces the noisy NCCL / TCPStore broken-pipe shutdown spam compared with force-killing individual workers.

### Resume Training

For DeepSpeed sharded checkpoints, resume by pointing `--load_model` at the checkpoint directory itself, for example:

```bash
--load_model /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-200.pth
```

`train.py` now detects DeepSpeed checkpoint directories automatically and passes them into Lightning via `ckpt_path`. This supports:

- `deepspeed_stage_1`
- `deepspeed_stage_2`
- `deepspeed_stage_2_offload`
- `deepspeed_stage_3`
- `deepspeed_stage_3_offload`

In practice, resuming usually just means:

1. edit `LOAD_MODEL` in [run_12b_zero3_offload.sh](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/run_12b_zero3_offload.sh) to the checkpoint directory you want
2. run the same script again

Example:

```bash
bash run_12b_zero3_offload.sh
```

### Smoke-Test Resume Before a Long Run

If you want to verify that a real ZeRO checkpoint can resume correctly before committing to a long training run, use [scripts/regression_resume_deepspeed_checkpoint.py](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/scripts/regression_resume_deepspeed_checkpoint.py):

```bash
python scripts/regression_resume_deepspeed_checkpoint.py \
  --checkpoint-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-200.pth \
  --log-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/resume-smoke-step200.log \
  --timeout-seconds 2400 \
  --steady-seconds 180 \
  -- \
  bash run_12b_zero3_offload.sh
```

This script:

- validates that the checkpoint path looks like a real DeepSpeed sharded checkpoint
- launches your normal training command
- waits for both resume markers and actual training progress
- stops the process group cleanly once resume looks healthy

### Convert a DeepSpeed Checkpoint to a Single `.pth`

Use [scripts/convert_deepspeed_checkpoint_to_pth.py](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/scripts/convert_deepspeed_checkpoint_to_pth.py):

```bash
python scripts/convert_deepspeed_checkpoint_to_pth.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.pth \
  --output-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --dtype bf16
```

Optional summary file:

```bash
python scripts/convert_deepspeed_checkpoint_to_pth.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.pth \
  --output-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --dtype bf16 \
  --summary-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/rwkv-step-20-summary.txt
```

### Verify the Converted `.pth` Matches the ZeRO Checkpoint

Use [scripts/test_converted_checkpoint_equivalence.py](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/scripts/test_converted_checkpoint_equivalence.py) to compare:

- reconstructed state_dict from the original ZeRO checkpoint
- converted single-file `.pth`
- forward logits on a real prompt

Important: always compare the same step against itself. Do not mix `rwkv-step-20.pth` with `rwkv-step-200.bf16.pth`.

Example:

```bash
python scripts/test_converted_checkpoint_equivalence.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.pth \
  --converted-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --dtype bf16 \
  --device cuda \
  --strict-forward \
  --summary-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/rwkv-step-20-equivalence.json
```

A successful run should end with:

```text
[equiv] state_dict match: ...
[equiv] forward check: ...
[equiv] PASS
```

If `max_abs_diff=0.0` and `topk_match=True`, the converted checkpoint matches exactly for both parameters and forward behavior.

### Run Inference on a Converted Single-File Checkpoint

Use [scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py). By default, `--prompt` is the user input text. The script builds the one-turn chat message internally and renders it with `--chat-template`; no external message JSON file is needed.

```bash
python scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py \
  --model-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --vocab-path rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt \
  --chat-template data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja \
  --device cuda \
  --dtype auto \
  --prompt "你好，请用一句话介绍 RWKV。" \
  --topk 10 \
  --max-new-tokens 32
```

Sampling example:

```bash
python scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py \
  --model-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --vocab-path rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt \
  --chat-template data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja \
  --device cuda \
  --dtype auto \
  --prompt "你好，请用一句话介绍 RWKV。" \
  --max-new-tokens 64 \
  --sample \
  --temperature 1.0 \
  --top-p 0.9
```

This demo automatically infers:

- `n_layer`
- `n_embd`
- `head_size`
- `D_DECAY_LORA`
- `D_AAA_LORA`
- `D_MV_LORA`
- `D_GATE_LORA`

from the checkpoint itself, so you do not need to hardcode 13.3B layout values by hand.

For old plain next-token continuation checks, bypass the chat template explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py \
  --model-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/12b-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-20.bf16.pth \
  --vocab-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/data/tokenizer/rwkv_vocab_v20230424.txt \
  --raw-prompt \
  --prompt "The Eiffel tower is in the city of" \
  --device cuda \
  --dtype auto \
  --topk 10
```

### Legacy `rwkv_v7_demo.py`

There is also a local [rwkv_v7_demo.py](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/rwkv_v7_demo.py) file that was adapted for prompt continuation. It is more manual and keeps its own hardcoded paths and settings.

Use it only if you specifically want that standalone demo style. For practical converted-checkpoint inference, prefer `scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py`.

## Detailed Explanation

This section contains explanations of model initialization, learning rates, and other details.

RWKV-7 uses initializations that are both theoretically designed with mathematical proof and empirically derived from training results to accelerate model convergence and improve performance.

### RWKV G1 model Lora Dim

|             | params | 0.1B | 0.4B | 1.5B | 2.9B | 7.2B | 13.3B |  
|-------------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|-------| 
|D_DECAY_LORA |   w    |  64  |  64  |  96  |  96  |  128 |  192  |
|D_AAA_LORA   |   a    |  64  |  64  |  96  |  96  |  128 |  192  |
|D_MV_LORA    |   v    |  32  |  32  |  64  |  64  |  96  |  128  |   
|D_GATE_LORA  |   g    |  128 |  128 |  256 |  320 |  480 |  384  |

### L2Warp

This type of penalty prevents the model from becoming overconfident, thereby mitigating precision loss in BF16.

### Weights and Initialization Example

Please pay close attention to the learning rate and related settings in the context.

```python
self.k_k = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 1, C)+0.71 - linear*0.1)
self.k_a = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 1, C)+1.02)
```

## Processing training data

### Convert jsonl to binidx format

Use `data/make_data.py` script to convert your training data from `.jsonl` format to `binidx` format.

```
python data/make_data.py [input_file] [n_epoch] [ctx_len]
# example:
cd data/
python make_data.py demo.jsonl 3 4096
```

This command will:

- shuffle & duplicate demo.jsonl (for 3 epochs)
- load jsonl and tokenize
- save as demo.bin & demo.idx
- compute "magic_prime" for ctxlen 4096

Assume your source jsonl is:

- {"text":"aa"}
- {"text":"bb"}
- {"text":"cc"}
- {"text":"dd"}

The final binidx will be like (here "/" means end_of_doc, which is actually token [0]): `bb/aa/dd/cc/dd/aa/bb/cc/dd/bb/cc/aa/`

> [!WARNING]
> make_data.py will be very slow for large jsonl,check [json2binidx_tool](https://github.com/Abel2076/json2binidx_tool) if you need to process large jsonl.

### Convert SFT messages jsonl to binidx + loss mask

SFT preprocessing uses `data/make_sft_binidx.py`. The input is one JSON object per line. Each object should contain `messages`, and may optionally contain `tools`. `messages` follows a chat-style structure with roles such as `system`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool`. Assistant tool-call arguments are normalized before rendering: JSON strings are parsed into structured arguments, while existing XML-style parameter fragments are preserved. The trainable target is the final assistant message. If a sample ends with one or more `tool` messages, those trailing tool results are trimmed before rendering, so the preceding assistant tool call can still be trained but external tool output is not included in the loss. Tool messages in the middle of a conversation are kept as non-trainable context for a later assistant reply.

Example:

```bash
python data/make_sft_binidx.py data/sft_part_000.jsonl data/sft_part_001.jsonl \
  --out-prefix data/sft_train \
  --vocab rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt \
  --chat-template data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja \
  --ctx-len 4096 \
  --pack \
  --num-workers 8 \
  --shuffle
```

You can also pass a directory containing JSONL shards. A directory input recursively expands to all nested `*.jsonl` files in sorted path order:

```bash
python data/make_sft_binidx.py data/sft_shards \
  --output-prefix data/sft_train \
  --ctx-len 4096 \
  --pack \
  --num-workers 8
```

To keep the original order across input files and epochs, disable shuffling:

```bash
python data/make_sft_binidx.py data/sft_part_000.jsonl data/sft_part_001.jsonl \
  --out-prefix data/sft_train_ordered \
  --no-shuffle
```

Use `--out-prefix` or its alias `--output-prefix` to choose the output binidx prefix. For example, `--out-prefix data/sft_train` writes `data/sft_train.bin`, `data/sft_train.idx`, `data/sft_train.mask.bin`, and `data/sft_train.mask.idx`. When passing more than one positional input path, the prefix is required because there is no single source name to infer it from. A single file defaults to that file name without `.jsonl`; a single directory defaults to the directory path as the prefix.

`--num-workers` is used in two places, and these workers are now processes rather than Python threads. Jinja rendering, JSON parsing, and tokenization can therefore use multiple CPU cores. On the default path, each JSONL file is one read task, so multiple files can be read concurrently; one large file is not split across workers at the read stage. `--pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing` reads and packs JSONL shards in bounded groups. `--pack-shard-group-size` defaults to `1`, which keeps memory low by processing one shard at a time, but the read stage can only read that one JSONL and best-fit can only optimize within that file. Raising it lets each group read multiple JSONL shards concurrently and best-fit pack across that group. Groups themselves are processed serially: group 2 starts only after group 1 has been read, tokenized, packed, and appended to the output builders. Inside a group, JSONL read concurrency is `min(group_size, num_workers, files_in_group)`. For example, `--pack-shard-group-size 8 --num-workers 32` reads at most 8 JSONL files at the same time, while rendering and tokenization still use up to 32 worker processes; `--pack-shard-group-size 64 --num-workers 32` reads at most 32 files at once and queues the remaining files. `--worker-chunksize` controls how many samples each render/tokenize worker task handles; the default is `64`, which usually reduces inter-process scheduling overhead. The progress bar is enabled by default and refreshes one stderr line with stage name, current file, processed/total count, remaining count, and speed; with multiple workers, only the main process refreshes the bar and workers do not print directly. Render/tokenize uses `ProcessPoolExecutor.map`, which executes concurrently but yields results in input order, so `file=...part_xxxx.jsonl:line` means "confirmed complete up to this input-order position" rather than "the most recently finished worker sample." Later files or lines may already be computed and buffered internally, but they are shown only after earlier samples are consumed in order. Output writes remain single-process append operations into one token binidx plus one mask sidecar. Output order remains deterministic, so the same inputs, `--seed`, shuffle setting, and group size produce reproducible datasets. Text files are read as UTF-8; JSONL also accepts a UTF-8 BOM. Chinese and other multi-byte text are mapped through UTF-8 byte spans, so mask projection does not lose non-ASCII content.

Example best-fit commands:

```bash
# Recommended bounded multi-file packing:
# groups are serial; each group has at most 8 JSONL files; reads use at most 8 workers here.
python data/make_sft_binidx.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_jsonl \
  --out-prefix /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --ctx-len 8192 \
  --pack \
  --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing \
  --pack-shard-group-size 8 \
  --num-workers 32 \
  --shuffle

# Larger group, same worker cap:
# each group has up to 64 JSONL files; at most 32 files are read concurrently, the rest queue.
python data/make_sft_binidx.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_jsonl \
  --out-prefix /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --ctx-len 8192 \
  --pack \
  --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing \
  --pack-shard-group-size 64 \
  --num-workers 32 \
  --shuffle
```

For long jobs, enable best-fit group caching. The cache is only supported with `--pack --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing --no-shuffle`. Each completed group writes a small token binidx, mask binidx, and meta file under `--pack-cache-dir`; after an interruption, rerun the same command and completed groups will be skipped before the final output is merged:

```bash
python data/make_sft_binidx.py /mnt/data/Datas/SFT_RWKV7_13B/sharded_cleaned \
  --out-prefix /mnt/data/Datasets/SFT_RWKV7_13B \
  --ctx-len 86016 \
  --pack \
  --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing \
  --pack-shard-group-size 8 \
  --num-workers 32 \
  --worker-chunksize 64 \
  --no-shuffle \
  --pack-cache-dir /mnt/data/Datasets/SFT_RWKV7_13B.cache \
  --error-log /mnt/data/Datasets/SFT_RWKV7_13B.errors.jsonl \
  --progress
```

If memory allows, try `--pack-shard-group-size 16`, `32`, or `64`. Larger groups give best-fit more samples to combine and allow more concurrent JSONL reads, but tokenized samples inside a group are held in memory. Your earlier `--pack-shard-group-size 1 --num-workers 32` uses 32 processes only during render/tokenize; the read stage still handles one JSONL at a time, and best-fit can only optimize within that single file. It is the lowest-memory setting, but usually not the fastest.

To diagnose bad JSON, template-rendering failures, or mask-boundary failures, add `--error-log PATH`. It is disabled by default. When enabled, preprocessing still stops on the first error; it does not skip bad samples. Before stopping, the main process appends one JSONL error record containing `source_path`, `line_number`, the error type and message, raw `source_text`, the parsed full `record`, and a compact `record_summary`. Successful samples are not logged, except for tagged informational events such as `label="trim_trailing_tool_messages"` when trailing `tool` results are removed before rendering. In multiprocessing mode, workers never write this file directly; they send the exact failing sample or tagged info event back to the main process, which writes the log centrally.

The high-level flow is:

1. Read one or more UTF-8 JSONL files, skip empty lines, and keep source path plus line number for error reporting.
2. Expand directory inputs recursively to all sorted `*.jsonl` files.
3. Repeat the source samples by `--n-epoch`. This is offline duplication before writing the dataset: `--n-epoch 3` writes each source sample three times into the produced binidx. The default is `--n-epoch 1`, so samples are not duplicated unless you explicitly raise it. By default each repeated pass is deterministically shuffled with `--seed`; `--no-shuffle` keeps input order for every pass.
4. Load the authoritative SFT chat template from `data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja`. The root template is not used by this preprocessing path.
5. Normalize tool-call arguments, then render each sample twice with the same Jinja template: one prefix render up to the final assistant turn for the context boundary, and one full render for the actual training text.
6. Normalize the final assistant turn so it always contains think tags. Existing think content is preserved; missing think content receives an empty think block before the visible reply. Historical assistant turns, system text, user text, and tool outputs are context only.
7. Derive the loss mask from the final assistant trainable suffix: everything before the final assistant content boundary is `0`. Real think content that comes from the sample is trainable, but the automatically added empty think block for no-think samples is context only and remains `0`; the visible reply, final tool calls, assistant ending segment, and real sample ending segment are `1`.
8. Tokenize the final text once. The code records each token's UTF-8 byte span, maps it back to character spans, and projects the character-level trainable region into a token-level mask. This handles Chinese, multi-byte symbols, and special fragments through the same path.
9. Without `--pack`, `--pad`, `--pack-length`, or `--pad-length`, each repeated source sample becomes one variable-length binidx document and one same-length mask document; no padding is added. Each independent document still ends with the real `EOD_TOKEN`, and that EOD is trainable. `--ctx-len`, `--pack-length`, and `--pad-length` are token counts, not character counts. The recommended form is `--ctx-len N --pack` or `--ctx-len N --pad`; the actual preprocessing length is `N + 1` to match next-token labels at training time. With `--pack` / `--pack-length`, samples are packed without splitting a sample. The default `ordered` strategy preserves input order: multiple complete samples may share one fixed-length document, the separator newline between samples is masked out, and if the next complete sample does not fit, the current document is right-padded and a new one starts. `--pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing` sorts samples by token length and uses a best-fit approximation to reduce padding; it still never splits a sample, but it does reorder samples. This strategy is applied independently inside each JSONL shard group. `--pack-shard-group-size 1` means one JSONL per group; larger values allow cross-file best-fit within a bounded batch, improving packing efficiency while avoiding all-data-in-memory behavior. All processed groups are appended into one final `PREFIX` binidx + mask output. With `--pad` / `--pad-length`, packing stays disabled and each source sample is padded independently. Overlong samples are filtered after tokenization and before packing/padding according to the target token length; they are dropped instead of stopping the whole build.
10. The output is the token dataset plus a mask sidecar: `PREFIX.bin`, `PREFIX.idx`, `PREFIX.mask.bin`, and `PREFIX.mask.idx`. SFT training reads tokens from the main dataset and loss participation from the sidecar mask.

Main parameters:

- `--chat-template`: SFT render template path. Defaults to `data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja`.
- `--vocab`: tokenizer vocab. Defaults to `rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt`.
- `--out-prefix` / `--output-prefix`: output binidx prefix. The four output files are derived from this prefix.
- `--n-epoch`: offline data repetition count. The default is `1`; values greater than `1` duplicate samples in the produced dataset.
- `--seed`: random seed for shuffling; it does not affect order when shuffle is disabled.
- `--shuffle` / `--no-shuffle`: whether to shuffle samples inside each epoch. Default is enabled.
- `--num-workers`: process worker count for concurrent reading, rendering, and tokenization. Default is `1`.
- `--worker-chunksize`: number of samples per render/tokenize worker task. Default is `64`; increase it for many short samples to reduce scheduling overhead, or lower it for very long samples and finer progress.
- `--progress` / `--no-progress`: whether to show the single-line progress bar. Default is enabled; progress is written to stderr while the final summary stays on stdout.
- `--progress-interval`: minimum progress-bar refresh interval in seconds. Default is `0.2`; set `0` to refresh after every sample.
- `--error-log`: JSONL path for failing samples. Disabled by default; when enabled, only exceptions are logged with the complete record and preprocessing still stops.
- `--ctx-len`: training context length in tokens. With `--pack` or `--pad`, preprocessing uses `ctx_len + 1`.
- `--pack`: enable ordered sample-preserving packing at `ctx_len + 1`. Disabled by default.
- `--pack-strategy`: packing strategy. Defaults to `ordered`; `best-fit-decreasing` reorders by length inside each JSONL shard group, uses a best-fit approximation to reduce padding, and appends all groups into one output dataset.
- `--pack-shard-group-size`: number of JSONL shards per best-fit group. Defaults to `1`; larger values enable concurrent multi-JSONL reads and cross-file packing inside each bounded group.
- `--pack-cache-dir`: best-fit group cache directory. Use only with `--pack --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing --no-shuffle`; rerunning the same command reuses complete cached groups.
- `--pad`: enable per-sample padding at `ctx_len + 1`. Disabled by default and mutually exclusive with `--pack`.
- `--pack-length`: legacy explicit fixed-length packing target in tokens.
- `--pad-length`: legacy explicit fixed-length per-sample padding target in tokens. Mutually exclusive with `--pack-length`.
- `--current-date`, `--current-location`: override or inject date and location fields in the system message.

### Train with SFT binidx data

Use `--data_type sft_binidx` when training on the SFT preprocessing output. `--data_file` is the binidx prefix without `.bin` or `.idx`; the trainer automatically loads `DATA_FILE.mask` unless `--sft_mask_file` is provided.

For SFT, `--epoch_steps` and `--epoch_count` are user-controlled. `epoch_steps` is the number of optimizer steps per epoch, and `epoch_count` is the number of epochs to run. This is different from pretraining `binidx`, where `train.py` keeps the historical magic-prime schedule.

To run exactly one full pass over the SFT binidx dataset, set `--sft_one_pass 1`. The trainer reads only `DATA_FILE.idx` to count documents, computes `epoch_steps = ceil(num_documents / effective_bsz)`, and sets `epoch_count=1`; `effective_bsz = num_nodes * devices * micro_bsz * accumulate_grad_batches`. If the rounded-up final step needs extra samples, the dataset wraps deterministically from the beginning, and the startup log reports the repeated tail sample count.

When you want to control the training length manually, pass `--epoch_steps` and `--epoch_count` directly:

```bash
python train.py \
  --load_model model/rwkv7-g1d-0.4b-20260210-ctx8192.pth \
  --proj_dir out/sft-0.4b \
  --data_file data/sft_train \
  --data_type sft_binidx \
  --ctx_len 4096 \
  --epoch_steps 1000 \
  --epoch_count 1 \
  --sft_one_pass 0 \
  --micro_bsz 1 \
  --accumulate_grad_batches 1 \
  --vocab_size 65536 \
  --n_layer 24 \
  --n_embd 1024 \
  --dim_ffn 4096 \
  --head_size 64 \
  --d_decay_lora 64 \
  --d_aaa_lora 64 \
  --d_mv_lora 32 \
  --d_gate_lora 128 \
  --my_testing x070 \
  --lr_init 1e-5 \
  --lr_final 1e-6 \
  --lr_wsd_decay_iters 0 \
  --lr_wsd_decay_style cosine \
  --warmup_steps 10 \
  --weight_decay 0 \
  --accelerator gpu \
  --devices 1 \
  --precision bf16 \
  --strategy deepspeed_stage_2 \
  --grad_cp 1
```

If you only want one full pass, let the trainer compute the step count with `--sft_one_pass 1`. In direct `train.py` usage you may omit `--epoch_steps` / `--epoch_count` because their integer defaults are overridden; do not pass empty strings:

```bash
python train.py \
  --load_model model/rwkv7-g1d-0.4b-20260210-ctx8192.pth \
  --proj_dir out/sft-0.4b-one-pass \
  --data_file data/sft_train \
  --data_type sft_binidx \
  --ctx_len 4096 \
  --sft_one_pass 1 \
  --micro_bsz 1 \
  --accumulate_grad_batches 4 \
  --vocab_size 65536 \
  --n_layer 24 \
  --n_embd 1024 \
  --dim_ffn 4096 \
  --head_size 64 \
  --d_decay_lora 64 \
  --d_aaa_lora 64 \
  --d_mv_lora 32 \
  --d_gate_lora 128 \
  --my_testing x070 \
  --lr_init 1e-5 \
  --lr_final 1e-6 \
  --lr_wsd_decay_iters 0 \
  --lr_wsd_decay_style cosine \
  --warmup_steps 10 \
  --weight_decay 0 \
  --accelerator gpu \
  --devices 1 \
  --precision bf16 \
  --strategy deepspeed_stage_2 \
  --grad_cp 1
```

In this generic example, `--accelerator gpu` tells Lightning to train on CUDA GPUs, and `--devices 1` means one GPU in the current node. For multi-GPU DeepSpeed on one node, set `--devices` to the GPU count, for example `--devices 8`; `train.py` will automatically relaunch itself with `torchrun` when `strategy` contains `deepspeed`, `num_nodes=1`, and `devices > 1`. In SFT scheduling, `real_bsz = num_nodes * devices * micro_bsz` is the global sample count per forward pass, and `effective_bsz = real_bsz * accumulate_grad_batches` is the sample count consumed by each optimizer step. `--my_exit_tokens` is intentionally omitted for SFT because SFT stops by `--epoch_count` or `--sft_one_pass`; `my_exit_tokens` is part of the pretraining token-limit schedule. `--lr_wsd_decay_iters 0` disables the SFT-specific final decay, so LR stays at `lr_init` after warmup. Set a positive value, for example `--lr_wsd_decay_iters 1000 --lr_wsd_decay_style cosine`, to decay from `lr_init` to `lr_final` over the final 1000 optimizer steps. `lr_wsd_decay_style` supports `none`, `linear`, and `cosine`.

Training samples use next-token labels, so the dataloader needs `ctx_len + 1` token ids per SFT document. A shorter document is padded in memory with `--sft_pad_token_id` and mask `0`; a longer document raises an error. For predictable fixed-length training, build data with `--ctx-len CTX_LEN --pack` or `--ctx-len CTX_LEN --pad`; preprocessing writes `CTX_LEN + 1` token documents, then train with `--ctx_len CTX_LEN`. For RWKV7 x070, keep `ctx_len` divisible by 16.

Keep `--sft_masked_ce_chunk` at `0` for now. `0` disables the experimental Python chunked masked-head CE path, so SFT uses the previous full-logits masked CE path; this setting itself does not add chunking, checkpoint recomputation, or repeated ZeRO-3 all-gather overhead. It still materializes full `[batch, ctx_len, vocab]` logits, so long-context memory pressure remains high. Positive Python chunk values can lower the Python loss-side logits peak, but server feedback shows that `4096/8192` still timeout for 13B + ZeRO-3 long-context training. Do not enable positive Python chunks for production runs.

The new `--sft_masked_fused_ce_chunk N` is a separate CUDA fused masked head CE path, not the Python chunk path above. When positive, SFT calls one fused CUDA op that internally uses an `N`-row temporary logits buffer to compute `hidden @ head.weight.T`, masked CE, `grad_hidden`, and `grad_weight`. Loss and gradients are normalized by `loss_mask.sum()`, L2Wrap is not applied, and the existing pretraining `(x, y)` fused CE path is unchanged. This path is currently CUDA/H800-oriented and defaults to `0`; run the server smokes below first, then try `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096` or `8192` in the 13B launcher.

CUDA operators split into two responsibility groups. Model-body operators are shared by pretraining and SFT; head / CE loss operators are where pretraining and SFT diverge:

| Operator / Path | Used by pretraining | Used by SFT | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rwkv7_clampw_v3` | Yes | Yes | RWKV7 time-mix recurrent core. It is enabled by `KERNEL=@rwkv3` and does not care whether the loss is pretraining CE or SFT masked CE. |
| `rwkv7_tmix_mix6_bf16_v5` | Yes | Yes | Time-mix preprocessing / mixing, part of the model body. |
| `rwkv7_cmix_bf16_v5` | Yes | Yes | Channel-mix, part of the model body. |
| `rwkv7_l2wrap_ce_bf16_v2` | Yes | No | Pretraining full-logits + targets L2Wrap CE path. |
| `rwkv7_head_l2wrap_ce_bf16_v4.forward` | Yes | No | Pretraining head fused CE: `hidden @ head.weight.T` + CE + L2Wrap, without an SFT mask. |
| `rwkv7_head_l2wrap_ce_bf16_v4.forward_masked` | No | Yes | SFT-only fused masked head CE: `hidden @ head.weight.T` + masked CE, no L2Wrap, normalized by `loss_mask.sum()`. |

So `rwkv7_clampw_v3` is not pretraining-only; both pretraining and SFT run through it. The truly pretraining-only pieces are mainly the L2Wrap, unmasked head/CE paths, while the SFT-only piece is the new `forward_masked` path.

The 0.4B checkpoint listed in the example is `L24-D1024` with `dim_ffn=4096`, `vocab_size=65536`, `head_size=64`, and RWKV7 G1 LoRA dimensions `64/64/32/128`. If you use another checkpoint, read its architecture text and keep these shape parameters aligned with the checkpoint.

SFT masked-training implementation:

1. Offline preprocessing writes two aligned binidx datasets. `PREFIX.bin/.idx` stores token ids, while `PREFIX.mask.bin/.idx` stores the same-length `0/1` loss mask.
2. `train.py` enters SFT mode with `--data_type sft_binidx`. This mode does not use the pretraining magic-prime schedule. It preserves user-provided `--epoch_steps` and `--epoch_count`, and sets Lightning `max_epochs` to `epoch_count`. When `--accumulate_grad_batches G` is enabled, `epoch_steps` still means optimizer steps; the dataloader provides `epoch_steps * G` micro-batches per epoch.
   When `--sft_one_pass 1` is enabled, this mode overrides manual `epoch_steps/epoch_count` with the automatically computed one-pass schedule and `epoch_count=1`.
3. `src/dataset.py::MyDataset` loads the token prefix from `--data_file` and the mask prefix from `--data_file.mask` by default. `--sft_mask_file` can override the mask prefix. Initialization validates matching document counts and identical per-document sizes.
4. Each SFT document may contain at most `ctx_len + 1` tokens. Short documents are padded in memory with `--sft_pad_token_id` and mask `0`; long documents raise an error instead of being silently truncated.
5. The dataset returns `(x, y, loss_mask)`: `x = token_ids[:-1]`, `y = token_ids[1:]`, and `loss_mask = raw_mask[1:]`. The mask is shifted so it marks whether each next-token target contributes to loss.
6. `src/model.py::training_step` dispatches by batch shape. Pretraining batches `(x, y)` keep the existing fused CE path. SFT batches `(x, y, loss_mask)` use `src/sft_loss.py::masked_cross_entropy` by default.
7. `masked_cross_entropy` computes per-token CE, averages only positions with `loss_mask=1`, and returns a differentiable zero loss if the mask is empty.
8. Keep `--sft_masked_ce_chunk` at `0` for now. A positive value switches to the Python chunked `src/sft_loss.py::masked_head_cross_entropy` path: the model body returns hidden states without first materializing full logits; the loss selects mask=1 target tokens and runs `hidden @ head.weight.T` plus CE in chunks of `N` trainable tokens. This remains useful for small-model or single-GPU numerical comparison, but it repeatedly triggers head-weight all-gather under 13B ZeRO-3 long-context training and has timed out on the server, so it is not recommended for production.
9. `--sft_masked_fused_ce_chunk N` is the new CUDA fused masked head CE path. It calls `rwkv7_head_l2wrap_ce_bf16_v4.forward_masked`, computes head logits and masked CE inside the CUDA op with an internal `N`-row chunk, and directly returns `grad_hidden/grad_weight`. This path does not use L2Wrap; it is meant to match current SFT masked CE numerically while avoiding full-logits OOM and Python chunk repeated all-gather.
10. Gradient accumulation is executed by Lightning through `--accumulate_grad_batches`; the SFT dataset uses the same value for epoch length, full-pass step calculation, and step-checkpoint mid-epoch resume offsets. Resuming from `rwkv-step-N.pth` skips `N * accumulate_grad_batches` micro-batches, not just `N` micro-batches.
11. SFT LR defaults to warmup-only scheduling and then stays at `lr_init`. When `--lr_wsd_decay_iters K` is enabled, the scheduler uses `total_steps = epoch_steps * epoch_count`, finds the final `K` optimizer steps, and decays from `lr_init` to `lr_final` using `--lr_wsd_decay_style linear|cosine`. This SFT WSD schedule is independent from `my_exit_tokens` and does not trigger the pretraining token-limit exit path.
   WSD uses the `global_step` restored by Lightning, so resume from a DeepSpeed/Lightning checkpoint keeps LR on the same curve. Keep `epoch_steps`, `epoch_count`, `lr_wsd_decay_iters`, `lr_wsd_decay_style`, `lr_init`, and `lr_final` unchanged when resuming; changing them intentionally means continuing from the current step on a newly interpreted LR curve.

WSD decay interval:

- `epoch_steps` is optimizer steps per SFT epoch.
- `epoch_count` is the number of SFT epochs in this run.
- `total_steps = epoch_steps * epoch_count`.
- `K = min(lr_wsd_decay_iters, total_steps)`.
- decay starts at optimizer step `total_steps - K`, using 0-based step counting.
- the matching epoch/step is:
  - `decay_start_epoch = (total_steps - K) // epoch_steps`
  - `decay_start_step_in_epoch = (total_steps - K) % epoch_steps`
- `lr_wsd_decay_iters=0` or `lr_wsd_decay_style=none` disables decay, so LR stays at `lr_init` after warmup.

Example: with `epoch_steps=12500`, `epoch_count=1`, and `lr_wsd_decay_iters=1000`, `total_steps=12500`; decay starts at global optimizer step `11500`, i.e. epoch 0 step 11500, and the final step reaches `lr_final`. With `epoch_count=3`, `total_steps=37500`, so the same `K=1000` starts decay at global step `36500`, i.e. epoch 2 step 11500.

Validation coverage:

- Default unit tests in `tests/test_sft_training.py` cover sidecar loading, mask shifting, padding, invalid masks, too-long documents, SFT epoch scheduling, dataset length/resume offsets under gradient accumulation, WSD LR scheduling, WSD resume step position, full-logits masked CE math, and chunked masked-head CE equivalence / zero-mask behavior.
- `tests/test_sft_binidx.py` covers authoritative Jinja rendering, think/no-think rules, Chinese UTF-8 spans, tool calls, packing, padding, recursive directory input, concurrent JSONL loading, and CLI parsing.
- `RWKV_RUN_CUDA_SFT_SMOKE=1` loads a real RWKV7 checkpoint, builds a tiny SFT binidx dataset, and runs CUDA forward/backward with masked SFT loss.
- `RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_SMOKE=1` launches `train.py` for one SFT step and covers Lightning, DeepSpeed, optimizer, and multi-card torchrun. Set `RWKV_SFT_SMOKE_ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES=2` or a similar value to cover the gradient-accumulation path.
- `RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_RESUME_SMOKE=1` saves `rwkv-step-1.pth` and resumes from it, covering SFT checkpoint resume and DeepSpeed sharded checkpoint loading.
- `RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_WSD_RESUME_SMOKE=1` uses DeepSpeed to save a step checkpoint, resumes from it, and checks that `train_log.txt` records the LR at the expected WSD decay position.
- `RWKV_RUN_CUDA_SFT_MASKED_CE_CHUNK_EQUIV_SMOKE=1` runs a single-GPU comparison between full-logits CE and the old `--sft_masked_ce_chunk` Python chunked CE. Keep this as an experimental numerical-comparison smoke only; do not enable positive Python chunks for 13B ZeRO-3 production runs.
- `RWKV_RUN_CUDA_SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_OP_EQUIV_SMOKE=1` runs a direct CUDA-op precision check for `rwkv7_head_l2wrap_ce_bf16_v4.forward_masked`: full-logits PyTorch masked CE vs fused CUDA loss, `grad_hidden`, `grad_weight`, plus the all-zero-mask case. This is the fastest way to verify the new operator itself.
- `RWKV_RUN_CUDA_SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_SMOKE=1` runs a single-GPU training-level comparison between full-logits CE and the new `--sft_masked_fused_ce_chunk` CUDA fused masked head CE, recording loss, gradient norms, sampled parameter differences, elapsed time, and CUDA peak memory.
- `RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_FUSED_CE_SMOKE=1` runs `train.py` with DeepSpeed/ZeRO and fused masked CE, checking that the multi-GPU strategy completes and writes a finite loss; this is closer to checking whether 13B still times out.

Current validation results:

  - `RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_MERGE_SMOKE=1` + `RWKV_SFT_SMOKE_DEVICES=8` + `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` -> `1 passed in 284.01s`.
- Server feedback: the old Python `--sft_masked_ce_chunk 4096/8192` still timed out for 13B + ZeRO-3 long-context training. Production launchers keep `SFT_MASKED_CE_CHUNK=0`. The new CUDA fused path is enabled separately through `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK` and should be smoke-tested first.

New fused masked CE server smoke commands:

```bash
RWKV_RUN_CUDA_SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_OP_EQUIV_SMOKE=1 \
RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_BATCH=2 \
RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_TIME=2049 \
RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_HIDDEN=4096 \
RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_CHUNKS=257,4096,8192 \
RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_EQUIV_SUMMARY_FILE=/tmp/rwkv_sft_fused_ce_op_equiv.json \
python -m pytest -q tests/test_sft_cuda_smoke.py::test_cuda_sft_masked_fused_ce_op_matches_full_logits
```

The op-level smoke does not need a model checkpoint. It compiles the CUDA extension, compares loss and max absolute gradient differences against full-logits PyTorch masked CE, and writes the measured differences to the summary file. The strict server command above uses BF16, real `vocab_size=65536`, 4098 rows, 13.3B hidden size 4096, a non-divisible chunk (`257`), the production-style chunk (`4096`), a chunk larger than rows (`8192`), and four mask patterns: all-active, sparse, single-token-active, and all-zero. Tolerances can be overridden with `RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_LOSS_ATOL`, `RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_GRAD_ATOL`, and `RWKV_SFT_FUSED_CE_OP_ZERO_ATOL`.

## 13.3B SFT Launcher Operations

The complete 13.3B example is [run_13b_sft_zero3_offload.sh](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/run_13b_sft_zero3_offload.sh). It is derived from `model/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b.txt`: `n_layer=61`, `n_embd=4096`, `dim_ffn=16384`, `vocab_size=65536`, `head_size=64`, and LoRA dimensions `192/192/128/384`. It defaults to 8xH800, `deepspeed_stage_3_offload`, activation checkpointing enabled, and SFT binidx+mask data. Every script setting can be overridden by an environment variable with the same name, so the recommended pattern is to put model, data, batch, LR, and checkpoint settings directly before the launcher command.

### 1. Prepare SFT binidx data

Step 1: prepare fixed-length SFT data. `--ctx-len 8192 --pack` writes `8193` tokens per document, because training uses next-token labels:

```bash
python data/make_sft_binidx.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_jsonl \
  --out-prefix /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --ctx-len 8192 \
  --pack \
  --pack-strategy best-fit-decreasing \
  --pack-shard-group-size 8 \
  --num-workers 32 \
  --shuffle
```

### 2. Calculate a manual schedule

Step 2: calculate `EPOCH_STEPS` for one full pass over the produced SFT documents:

```bash
python scripts/calc_sft_onepass_steps.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --num-nodes 1 \
  --devices 8 \
  --micro-bsz 1 \
  --accumulate-grad-batches 1 \
  --eval-tail-ratio 0.005 \
  --eval-include-in-train 0 \
  --n-pass 1 \
  --ctx-len 8192
```

The script reads only `DATA_FILE.idx`, so it is fast even for large `.bin` files. It prints `total_documents`, `train_documents`, `eval_documents`, `epoch_steps`, `epoch_count`, `total_optimizer_steps`, the tail samples repeated by `ceil(...)`, and checkpoint interval estimates for several measured seconds/step values. `--eval-include-in-train 0` means held-out eval: tail eval documents are excluded from training. Set it to `1` when you want to train on all documents while still evaluating on the tail split as an overlapping monitor.

Common eval variants:

```bash
# held-out: reserve the tail 0.5% for eval only
python scripts/calc_sft_onepass_steps.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --num-nodes 1 --devices 8 --micro-bsz 1 --accumulate-grad-batches 1 \
  --eval-tail-ratio 0.005 --eval-include-in-train 0 \
  --n-pass 1 --ctx-len 8192

# overlap: train on all documents, while using the tail 0.5% as a fixed eval monitor
python scripts/calc_sft_onepass_steps.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --num-nodes 1 --devices 8 --micro-bsz 1 --accumulate-grad-batches 1 \
  --eval-tail-ratio 0.005 --eval-include-in-train 1 \
  --n-pass 1 --ctx-len 8192

# fixed eval document count; --eval-tail-docs > 0 takes priority over --eval-tail-ratio
python scripts/calc_sft_onepass_steps.py /mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
  --num-nodes 1 --devices 8 --micro-bsz 1 --accumulate-grad-batches 1 \
  --eval-tail-docs 2000 --eval-include-in-train 0 \
  --n-pass 1 --ctx-len 8192
```

In the output, `total_documents` is the full dataset size, `eval_documents` is the tail eval split, and `train_documents` is the document count used for the training schedule. With `eval_include_in_train=0`, `train_documents = total_documents - eval_documents`, so train and eval do not overlap. With `eval_include_in_train=1`, `train_documents = total_documents`, so training uses all documents and eval is an overlapping monitor. `epoch_steps = ceil(train_documents / effective_bsz)`, so held-out eval produces slightly fewer training steps than overlap eval.

### 3. Launch 13.3B SFT

Step 3: launch 13.3B SFT on 8 H800 GPUs:

For `ctx_len=86016`, 160G-scale SFT data, and an approximately 20-day 13.3B run window, use this self-contained launcher directly. It keeps the 13.3B model shape, SFT data, DeepSpeed, LR, checkpoint, eval, and loss-chunk settings in the same file. The current default is a manual schedule: `SFT_ONE_PASS=0`, `EPOCH_STEPS=45000`, `EPOCH_COUNT=1`, tail `0.5%` held-out eval, `SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS=20` with eval at the same cadence, and cosine WSD decay over the final `15000` steps. The defaults are conservative: `micro_bsz=1`, 8 GPUs, no gradient accumulation, ZeRO-3-offload, block activation checkpointing, `lr=5e-6`, `weight_decay=0.001`, and 200 warmup steps. If you later want an exact full pass or a different wall-time window, first recompute with `scripts/calc_sft_onepass_steps.py`, then update `EPOCH_STEPS`, eval, and checkpoint cadence.

Edit `LOAD_MODEL`, `DATA_FILE`, `PROJ_DIR`, `SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS`, `LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS`, and other top-of-file settings in `run_13b_sft_ctx86016_onepass.sh`, then run:

```bash
bash run_13b_sft_ctx86016_onepass.sh
```

After you know the one-pass step count, a practical starting point is to set `LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS` to the final 5%-10% of optimizer steps. If the target wall time is about 20 days and you want a checkpoint every half day, set `SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS` to roughly total optimizer steps divided by `40`, or derive it from the measured first few hours of throughput.

Use this form when you want manual control over one or more passes. Compute `EPOCH_STEPS` for one pass, then set `EPOCH_COUNT=N` for `N` passes:

```bash
LOAD_MODEL=/mnt/data/Models/RWKV-7/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b.pth \
DATA_FILE=/mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
PROJ_DIR=/mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload \
CTX_LEN=8192 \
N_NODE=1 \
GPU_PER_NODE=8 \
MICRO_BSZ=1 \
ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES=4 \
EPOCH_STEPS=12500 \
EPOCH_COUNT=1 \
SFT_ONE_PASS=0 \
STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3_offload \
GRAD_CP=1 \
LR_INIT=1e-5 \
LR_FINAL=1e-6 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS=1000 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_STYLE=cosine \
WARMUP_STEPS=10 \
EPOCH_SAVE=1 \
SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS=0 \
KEEP_LAST_N_CHECKPOINTS=3 \
WANDB_PROJECT=RWKV-13B-SFT \
bash run_13b_sft_zero3_offload.sh
```

For exactly one full pass, the lower-friction form is `SFT_ONE_PASS=1`. `train.py` overrides the script's placeholder `EPOCH_STEPS/EPOCH_COUNT` values:

```bash
LOAD_MODEL=/mnt/data/Models/RWKV-7/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b.pth \
DATA_FILE=/mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
PROJ_DIR=/mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-one-pass \
CTX_LEN=8192 \
N_NODE=1 \
GPU_PER_NODE=8 \
MICRO_BSZ=1 \
ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES=4 \
SFT_ONE_PASS=1 \
STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3_offload \
GRAD_CP=1 \
LR_INIT=1e-5 \
LR_FINAL=1e-6 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS=1000 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_STYLE=cosine \
WARMUP_STEPS=10 \
EPOCH_SAVE=1 \
SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS=0 \
KEEP_LAST_N_CHECKPOINTS=3 \
WANDB_PROJECT=RWKV-13B-SFT \
bash run_13b_sft_zero3_offload.sh
```

### 4. Launcher parameters

Key parameters:

- `MODEL_TYPE`, `N_LAYER`, `N_EMBD`, `DIM_FFN`, `VOCAB_SIZE`, `HEAD_SIZE`, `D_DECAY_LORA`, `D_AAA_LORA`, `D_MV_LORA`, `D_GATE_LORA`: model-shape parameters. Defaults match RWKV7 G1F 13.3B. Keep them aligned with the architecture text when changing checkpoints.
- `LOAD_MODEL`: initial 13.3B checkpoint, or a saved `rwkv-step-N.pth` / `rwkv-N.pth` checkpoint for resume. DeepSpeed checkpoint directories are supported when the strategy is DeepSpeed.
- `DATA_FILE`: SFT binidx prefix, without `.bin` or `.idx`. The script expects `DATA_FILE.bin`, `DATA_FILE.idx`, `DATA_FILE.mask.bin`, and `DATA_FILE.mask.idx`.
- `CTX_LEN`: training context length. It must match the preprocessing `--ctx-len`; the binidx documents should contain `CTX_LEN + 1` tokens.
- `N_NODE`, `GPU_PER_NODE`, `MICRO_BSZ`: define the real global batch size for one forward pass: `real_bsz = N_NODE * GPU_PER_NODE * MICRO_BSZ`.
- `ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES`: gradient accumulation steps. SFT commonly uses this to increase effective batch size when `MICRO_BSZ=1`; `effective_bsz = real_bsz * ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES`.
- `EPOCH_STEPS`: optimizer steps per SFT epoch. For one full pass, use `ceil(num_sft_documents / effective_bsz)`.
- `EPOCH_COUNT`: number of SFT passes. For `N` passes over the SFT data, keep `EPOCH_STEPS` from the one-pass formula and set `EPOCH_COUNT=N`.
- `SFT_ONE_PASS`: set to `1` to let `train.py` read `DATA_FILE.idx` and override the schedule with `epoch_steps=ceil(num_documents / effective_bsz)` and `epoch_count=1`. This is the low-friction option when you want exactly one full pass. Direct `train.py` usage may omit `--epoch_steps/--epoch_count`; this launcher still passes integer placeholders, but you do not need to care about their defaults in one-pass mode.
- `SFT_EVAL_TAIL_RATIO` / `SFT_EVAL_TAIL_DOCS`: reserve the tail of the same SFT binidx as an eval split. `SFT_EVAL_TAIL_DOCS` takes priority when positive; otherwise the ratio is rounded up. This does not require generating a second eval binidx.
- `SFT_EVAL_INCLUDE_IN_TRAIN`: `0` means held-out eval, so tail eval documents are removed from training and one-pass scheduling uses only train documents; in this mode the tail ratio must be below `1`. `1` means overlap mode: training uses all documents, while eval still reads the tail split for monitoring; in this mode `SFT_EVAL_TAIL_RATIO=1` is allowed when you want full-data training plus full-data eval monitoring.
- `SFT_EVAL_EVERY_N_STEPS` / `SFT_EVAL_STEPS`: run fixed-step SFT eval every N optimizer steps for the given number of eval micro-batches per rank. If the same step also saves a checkpoint, both actions run. Eval logs to `train_log.txt` and wandb keys `eval/loss`, `eval/ppl`, `eval/mask_tokens`, and `eval/docs`.
- `GRAD_CP`: activation checkpointing. `1` enables block-level checkpointing to save VRAM; `0` disables it and is faster if memory allows.
- `SFT_MASKED_CE_CHUNK`: experimental head/CE chunk size for SFT masked loss. Production defaults to `0`, which uses full-logits masked CE; `0` itself has no extra chunking overhead, but it materializes full logits. Positive values compute head and CE only for mask=1 target tokens in chunks, but currently timeout under 13B ZeRO-3 long-context training and are not recommended for production.
- `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK`: internal row chunk size for the new CUDA fused masked head CE. The 13B launchers default to `4096`, which is the current recommended production path for ctx86016 SFT; if long runs hit occasional OOMs, try `2048` first. Do not set it positive together with `SFT_MASKED_CE_CHUNK`.
- `STRATEGY`: defaults to `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` for lower VRAM. Use `deepspeed_stage_3` for pure ZeRO-3 if memory allows.
- `LR_INIT`, `LR_FINAL`, `WARMUP_STEPS`, `WEIGHT_DECAY`: SFT learning-rate schedule and regularization. With the default `LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS=0`, LR stays at `LR_INIT` after warmup. Set `LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS=K` to decay over the final `K` optimizer steps to `LR_FINAL` with `LR_WSD_DECAY_STYLE=cosine|linear`.
- Resume LR: when resuming from a DeepSpeed/Lightning checkpoint, `trainer.global_step` is restored and WSD continues from that step. Do not casually change `EPOCH_STEPS/EPOCH_COUNT/LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS/LR_WSD_DECAY_STYLE/LR_INIT/LR_FINAL` on resume, or the later LR curve will be reinterpreted from the current step.
- `EPOCH_SAVE`, `SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS`, `KEEP_LAST_N_CHECKPOINTS`: checkpoint cadence and retention.
- `PROJ_DIR`: output directory for logs and checkpoints.
- `WANDB_PROJECT`: empty disables wandb; a non-empty value enables logging under that project.
- wandb training metrics: `train/loss` is the current-step loss, `train/epoch_loss` is the running epoch-average loss, `train/lr` / `train/weight_decay` are optimizer settings, `train/grad_norm` is logged when a global grad norm is available, `train/samples` is cumulative trained samples, and `train/tokens` / `train/tokens_b` are cumulative trained tokens plus the billion-token view. Throughput metrics live under `perf/*`: `perf/iteration_time_sec`, `perf/optimizer_steps_per_sec`, `perf/tokens_per_sec`, `perf/ktokens_per_sec`, and `perf/samples_per_sec`.
- `KERNEL`: RWKV7 CUDA kernel selector. The default is `@rwkv3`.
- `HEAD_CHUNK`: head chunking setting. The default is `0`; keep it unchanged unless you are intentionally testing memory/perf behavior.
- `DS_BUCKET_MB`: DeepSpeed all-gather / reduce-scatter bucket size in MB. The 13B launchers default to `64`; the bucket-only `128` test did not improve speed and was slightly slower.
- `DS_OFFLOAD_PIN_MEMORY`: DeepSpeed offload `pin_memory` switch. `-1` keeps the strategy default; `0/1` forces disabled/enabled. The 13B launchers default to `1` to reduce CPU offload H2D/D2H wait.
- `DS_STAGE3_PARAM_PERSISTENCE_THRESHOLD`: maps to DeepSpeed `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`, measured in parameter elements, not bytes. The 13B launchers default to `0`, which avoids extra small-parameter residency and keeps healthier VRAM headroom.
- `DS_STAGE3_PREFETCH_BUCKET_SIZE`: maps to DeepSpeed `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size`, measured in parameter elements. The 13B launchers default to `5000000`, part of the current lowmem A/B winner.
- `DS_STAGE3_MAX_LIVE_PARAMETERS`: maps to DeepSpeed `stage3_max_live_parameters`, measured in parameter elements. The 13B launchers default to `200000000` to limit live parameters and control peak VRAM.
- `MASTER_ADDR`, `MASTER_PORT`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: single-node torchrun / distributed initialization settings.
- `TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR`, `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`, `MAX_JOBS`: CUDA extension cache, target architecture, and parallel build settings. H800 commonly uses `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=9.0`.

### 5. Resume from a checkpoint

Step checkpoints are saved as `PROJ_DIR/rwkv-step-N.pth`. With a DeepSpeed strategy this path is a directory containing ZeRO shards and trainer state. Resume by pointing `LOAD_MODEL` at that directory, while keeping model shape, data, batch, LR/WSD, and DeepSpeed strategy aligned with the original run:

```bash
LOAD_MODEL=/mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.pth \
DATA_FILE=/mnt/data/datasets/sft_train_ctx8192 \
PROJ_DIR=/mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload \
CTX_LEN=8192 \
N_NODE=1 \
GPU_PER_NODE=8 \
MICRO_BSZ=1 \
ACCUMULATE_GRAD_BATCHES=4 \
EPOCH_STEPS=12500 \
EPOCH_COUNT=1 \
SFT_ONE_PASS=0 \
STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3_offload \
GRAD_CP=1 \
LR_INIT=1e-5 \
LR_FINAL=1e-6 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_ITERS=1000 \
LR_WSD_DECAY_STYLE=cosine \
WARMUP_STEPS=10 \
SAVE_EVERY_N_STEPS=1000 \
KEEP_LAST_N_CHECKPOINTS=3 \
WANDB_PROJECT=RWKV-13B-SFT \
bash run_13b_sft_zero3_offload.sh
```

If the original run used `SFT_ONE_PASS=1`, resume may keep `SFT_ONE_PASS=1`, but make sure `DATA_FILE`, `effective_bsz`, and LR/WSD settings did not change unintentionally. `train.py` detects DeepSpeed checkpoint directories and passes them to Lightning as `ckpt_path`; in this path `epoch_begin` is reset to `0`, and real progress comes from the restored `global_step`.

### 6. Merge a DeepSpeed sharded checkpoint

After training, or before inference validation, convert the DeepSpeed/ZeRO checkpoint directory into a plain single-file `.pth`. `--checkpoint-dir` points at the saved checkpoint directory, `--output-file` is the merged checkpoint, and `--summary-file` writes parameter names, shapes, dtypes, and total parameter count:

```bash
python scripts/convert_deepspeed_checkpoint_to_pth.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.pth \
  --output-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.bf16.pth \
  --dtype bf16 \
  --summary-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.summary.txt
```

If you have the architecture summary file, add `--verify-summary-file model/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b.txt` to validate shape, dtype, and total parameter count. The 13.3B file is large, so run this on the server and make sure the output filesystem has enough free space.

### 7. Verify merged-checkpoint equivalence

Use this script to compare the state dict reconstructed from the original ZeRO checkpoint with the converted single-file `.pth`. `--strict-forward` also runs a real forward pass; remove it if you only want tensor equality first:

```bash
python scripts/test_converted_checkpoint_equivalence.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.pth \
  --converted-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.bf16.pth \
  --dtype bf16 \
  --strict-forward \
  --chat-template data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja \
  --prompt "你好，请用一句话介绍 RWKV。" \
  --device cuda \
  --demo-vocab-path rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt \
  --summary-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.equiv.json
```

### 8. Run an inference smoke test

`scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py` is a lightweight generation demo. It infers layer count, hidden size, LoRA dimensions, and head size from the `.pth`, so you do not need to pass 13.3B shape parameters manually. By default, `--prompt` is treated as the user input; the script builds a one-turn `user` message internally and renders it with `data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja` before feeding it to the model. SFT preprocessing defaults to `rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt`, so pass the same vocab explicitly for inference checks:

```bash
python scripts/run_converted_rwkv_demo.py \
  --model-path /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.bf16.pth \
  --vocab-path rwkv_vocab_v20260603.txt \
  --chat-template data/SFT/sample/chat_template.jinja \
  --prompt "你好，请用一句话介绍 RWKV。" \
  --device cuda \
  --dtype auto \
  --topk 10 \
  --max-new-tokens 64 \
  --temperature 1.0 \
  --top-p 0.8 \
  --sample
```

This demo validates that the converted checkpoint loads, runs forward, and generates through the SFT chat template. Add `--system-prompt`, `--current-date`, or `--current-location` when you need those system fields. Add `--raw-prompt` only when you want plain next-token continuation without chat-template rendering.

To combine DeepSpeed shard conversion and the prompt smoke test in one command, use the wrapper below. If the output `.pth` already exists, it is reused so repeated prompt checks do not reconvert a 13B checkpoint; add `--force-convert` when you intentionally want to rebuild it:

```bash
python scripts/convert_and_run_rwkv_demo.py \
  --checkpoint-dir /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.pth \
  --output-file /mnt/data/Codes/RWKV/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/outs/13b-sft-zero3-offload/rwkv-step-1000.bf16.pth \

### 9. 13.3B SFT Profiling / ZeRO Diagnosis

[run_13b_sft_profile.sh](/D:/codes/RWKV-LM-V7-12B-train/run_13b_sft_profile.sh) is a short diagnostic launcher, not the production long-run script. It reuses the 13.3B / ctx86016 / SFT mask settings, defaults to `PROFILE_STEPS=8` optimizer steps, disables checkpoint saving and wandb, and writes artifacts under `PROJ_DIR`:

- `train.log`: full train.py output and step timing.
- `gpu_monitor.csv`: background `nvidia-smi` samples with GPU utilization, memory, and power.
- `vmstat.log`: coarse CPU / IO samples; skipped automatically when `vmstat` is unavailable.
- `nccl.*.log`: one NCCL log per process when `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`.
- `nsys_sft_profile.nsys-rep` / `nsys_stats.txt`: CUDA / cuBLAS timeline and summary when `PROFILE_MODE=nsys`; use `NCCL_DEBUG_FILE` for NCCL details. Some nsys versions also show NCCL kernels as CUDA kernels.

First run without nsys to confirm real step time and GPU utilization:

```bash
LOAD_MODEL=/mnt/data/Models/RWKV-7/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b-20260415-ctx8192.pth \
DATA_FILE=/mnt/data/Datasets/SFT_RWKV7_13B/results/SFT_RWKV7_13B \
PROFILE_STEPS=20 \
SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096 \
STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3_offload \
bash run_13b_sft_profile.sh
```

Then run a short nsys capture to see CUDA kernels, cuBLAS, and any visible NCCL kernels on the timeline. The trace can be large, so start with 4-8 steps:

```bash
LOAD_MODEL=/mnt/data/Models/RWKV-7/rwkv7-g1f-13.3b-20260415-ctx8192.pth \
DATA_FILE=/mnt/data/Datasets/SFT_RWKV7_13B/results/SFT_RWKV7_13B \
PROFILE_STEPS=6 \
PROFILE_MODE=nsys \
NCCL_DEBUG=INFO \
SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096 \
STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3_offload \
bash run_13b_sft_profile.sh
```

Read the artifacts with these rules of thumb:

- If `gpu_monitor.csv` shows low GPU utilization for long stretches while `train.log` step time is high, the run is likely waiting on CPU offload, IO, synchronization, or communication rather than raw CUDA math.
- If `NCCL_DEBUG_FILE` shows dense collectives, or if the nsys timeline / `nsys_stats.txt` is dominated by `nccl*` kernels, ZeRO all-gather / reduce-scatter / communication synchronization is the bottleneck. Some nsys versions do not support `--trace=nccl`; the script defaults to `cuda,nvtx,osrt,cublas`, which is expected.
- If `cublas*gemm*`, `rwkv7_*`, or `wkv7*` kernels dominate and GPU utilization is high, the bottleneck is in the model trunk, matrix multiplies, or custom CUDA kernels.
- If VRAM is already close to full, do not increase `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK`; drop it to `2048` for stability if OOMs appear. Keep `SFT_MASKED_CE_CHUNK=0`.
- To compare offload overhead, change only `STRATEGY`: `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` saves VRAM but can be slower, while `deepspeed_stage_3` uses more VRAM and helps confirm whether CPU offload is the bottleneck.

One 13.3B / ctx86016 / 8xH800 / ZeRO-3-offload / `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096` 6-step nsys run produced the table below. Percentages are accumulated multi-GPU kernel-time shares, useful for ranking bottlenecks but not equal to per-step wall-clock:

| Category | Share | Observation | Optimization Direction |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `wkv7/clampw` forward/backward | 38.7% | RWKV recurrent core is the largest single item | If writing more CUDA, prioritize `wkv7_cuda` / `rwkv7_clampw_v3` tuning for `B=1,T=86016,H=64,head_size=64` |
| cuBLASLt GEMM | 37.9% | Linear layers plus head projection/grad GEMMs are heavy | Mostly affected by batch/ZeRO/VRAM strategy; CE small kernels are no longer the bottleneck |
| NCCL kernels | 11.9% | `AllGather` about 8.1%, `ReduceScatter` about 2.2%, many tiny AllGathers | Test non-offload `deepspeed_stage_3`; otherwise tune bucket size, pin memory, stage3 persistence/prefetch/live parameters |
| RWKV custom pointwise | 7.4% | tmix/cmix/vres/a_gate kernels | Not first priority unless a later profile shows one kernel is abnormal |
| PyTorch elementwise/reduce/copy | 2.8% | Scattered tensor ops | Low priority |
| PyTorch LayerNorm | 1.2% | LN is not a main bottleneck | Fused LN is unlikely to move the needle much right now |
| SFT fused masked CE small kernels | 0.1% | mask/softmax small kernels are light | The fused CE path has met its OOM/timeout goal; further CE gains would mainly come from head GEMM / active-row compaction |

Practical priority table:

| Priority | Bottleneck Hypothesis | Evidence | Next Experiment | Success Signal | Main Risk |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ZeRO-3 offload / parameter movement is limiting utilization | NCCL kernels are about 11.9%, many small AllGathers, D2H/H2D memops are visible, sampled GPU util is only about 66% | Compare pure `deepspeed_stage_3` with tuned `deepspeed_stage_3_offload`; tune `DS_BUCKET_MB`, `DS_OFFLOAD_PIN_MEMORY`, `DS_STAGE3_*` | Step time drops and GPU util rises without OOM; NCCL / memcopy pressure becomes less dominant | Pure ZeRO-3 or larger buckets may exceed 80G VRAM |
| 2 | Model trunk kernels are the real compute floor | `wkv7/clampw` plus cuBLASLt GEMM are about 76.6% of accumulated kernel time | Profile after ZeRO/offload tuning; only then consider `rwkv7_clampw_v3` / long-context kernel work | nsys still dominated by `wkv7/clampw` / GEMM while GPU util is high | CUDA work is more complex and may not improve communication waits |
| 3 | SFT fused masked CE is needed for memory, not current speed | CE small kernels are about 0.1%, but full logits previously caused OOM/timeout risk at ctx86016 | Keep `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096` or lower to `2048` if OOM; run the op-level and training-level precision smokes | No full-logits OOM, finite loss, op loss/grad diffs within tolerance | Larger fused chunks increase peak VRAM |
| 4 | Python/data input is not the bottleneck during training | CPU and disk IO were not busy in the profile run | Do not optimize dataloader first; revisit only if `gpu_monitor.csv` shows idle GPUs with low NCCL/kernel time | Training remains GPU/communication-bound | Premature dataloader work will not move step time |
| 5 | LayerNorm / small PyTorch ops are not first-order | LayerNorm is about 1.2%, PyTorch elementwise/reduce/copy about 2.8% | Defer fused LayerNorm / small-op cleanup | Only revisit if a later profile changes the ranking | Low expected payoff |

The same run also showed roughly `66%` average sampled GPU utilization, peak VRAM around `80.1GiB / 81.6GiB`, and low CPU / disk IO pressure. GPU memops included substantial D2H/H2D time, so offload and ZeRO parameter movement are real costs. Compare pure ZeRO-3 against tuned ZeRO-3-offload next:

The DeepSpeed A/B short-run results below all use 13.3B / ctx86016 / 8xH800 / `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` / `SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096` / `PROFILE_STEPS=20`. `tail avg` uses tqdm metrics after step 10; `active GPU util` only counts active training samples. The `tuned bucket128` row is not a bucket-only comparison because it also increases stage3 persistence / prefetch / live-parameter settings, so its higher VRAM should not be attributed solely to `DS_BUCKET_MB=128`.

| Run | `DS_BUCKET_MB` | `pin_memory` | `param_persistence` | `prefetch_bucket` | `max_live` | tail avg s/it | tail avg Kt/s | active GPU util | peak VRAM | Takeaway |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `ds-baseline-default` | 64 | default/false | default | default | default | 38.170 | 18.700 | 90.5% | 80077 MiB | Slow and high VRAM; baseline only |
| `ds-offload-lowmem` | 32 | 1 | 0 | 5000000 | 200000000 | 35.682 | 19.655 | 96.4% | 78615 MiB | Stable, lower VRAM, about 6.5% faster than baseline |
| `ds-offload-lowmem-bucket64` | 64 | 1 | 0 | 5000000 | 200000000 | 35.541 | 19.809 | 96.8% | 78675 MiB | Current recommendation; only about 60 MiB more peak VRAM than bucket32 |
| `ds-offload-lowmem-bucket128` | 128 | 1 | 0 | 5000000 | 200000000 | 36.196 | 19.409 | 96.3% | 78815 MiB | Bucket-only 128 did not improve speed; it was slower than 64 |
| `ds-offload-tuned` | 128 | 1 | 100000 | 20000000 | 1000000000 | 35.343 | 20.045 | 95.6% | 80129 MiB | Slightly faster but too tight on VRAM for a long default |

Current recommended long-run settings:

```bash
DS_BUCKET_MB=64
DS_OFFLOAD_PIN_MEMORY=1
DS_STAGE3_PARAM_PERSISTENCE_THRESHOLD=0
DS_STAGE3_PREFETCH_BUCKET_SIZE=5000000
DS_STAGE3_MAX_LIVE_PARAMETERS=200000000
SFT_MASKED_FUSED_CE_CHUNK=4096
```

The bucket-only comparison shows that `DS_BUCKET_MB=128` itself only adds about `140 MiB` peak VRAM over bucket64, but tail avg s/it regressed from `35.541` to `36.196`. The speed of `ds-offload-tuned` comes from the more aggressive stage3 persistence / prefetch / live-parameter combination, not from bucket=128 alone; however, its peak VRAM reached `80129 MiB`, which is too tight for a 20-day default.

If you still want to explore a more aggressive middle ground, keep it as a short-run experiment first:

```

The first command runs an in-process CUDA forward/backward on SFT masked loss. The second command compares masked loss precision for the same synthetic SFT batch computed as one large batch versus split micro-batches under the gradient-accumulation math; by default it compares `micro_bsz=2, accumulate=1` with `micro_bsz=1, accumulate=2`, uses `RWKV_SFT_ACCUM_EQUIV_ATOL=1e-2` and `RWKV_SFT_ACCUM_EQUIV_RTOL=1e-3`, and can write the measured diff to `RWKV_SFT_ACCUM_EQUIV_SUMMARY_FILE`. The third command launches `train.py` + multi-card DeepSpeed/ZeRO twice and compares the first epoch loss for `micro_bsz=2, accumulate=1` against `micro_bsz=1, accumulate=2` under DP/ZeRO, using `RWKV_SFT_DP_ZERO_ACCUM_EQUIV_ATOL=1e-2` and `RWKV_SFT_DP_ZERO_ACCUM_EQUIV_RTOL=1e-3`; it can write the measured diff to `RWKV_SFT_DP_ZERO_ACCUM_EQUIV_SUMMARY_FILE`. The fourth command launches `train.py` for one SFT step and also validates the Lightning/DeepSpeed/optimizer path. The fifth command saves `rwkv-step-1.pth` and resumes from it, covering SFT checkpoint resume and DeepSpeed sharded checkpoint loading when a DeepSpeed strategy is used. The sixth command specifically validates WSD LR resume: by default `epoch_steps=33`, `warmup_steps=4`, and `lr_wsd_decay_iters=9`, so steps 0-3 warm up, steps 4-23 hold `lr_init`, step 24 enters WSD decay, step 28 reaches the half-decay point and saves a checkpoint, and resume continues through step 32 where the logged LR reaches `lr_final`. This avoids false positives from still being in warmup or decaying from the start, and covers checkpointing in the middle of decay. The seventh command creates a tiny SFT DeepSpeed checkpoint, converts the sharded checkpoint directory to a single `.pth`, reloads it, and compares it against the reconstructed ZeRO checkpoint. The eighth command compares training loss with eval/wandb disabled versus tail eval plus fake wandb enabled; it uses overlap eval (`sft_eval_include_in_train=1`) so the training sample count and order stay unchanged, and the fake wandb module records `wandb.init`, `train/loss`, and `eval/loss` to a temporary jsonl without requiring a wandb login or network access. On multi-GPU servers, add `RWKV_SFT_SMOKE_DEVICES=8`; `train.py` will relaunch with torchrun for multi-card DeepSpeed. You can also set `RWKV_SFT_SMOKE_STRATEGY=deepspeed_stage_3` or `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` to validate a different sharding mode.

To test pth merge for an existing checkpoint directory instead of training a tiny one first:

```bash
RWKV_RUN_TRAIN_PY_SFT_MERGE_SMOKE=1 \

### Compute magic_prime for specified binidx dataset

The `data/compute_magic_prime.py` script computes the correct values of `--my_exit_tokens` and `--magic_prime` for a specified binidx dataset and context length (ctx_len).

- change the `DATA_NAME` and `CTX_LEN` in the `data/compute_magic_prime.py` for your training dataset and context length
- run the script to get the correct values of `--my_exit_tokens` and `--magic_prime`

```
cd data/
python compute_magic_prime.py
```

output will be like:

```
